Project Proposal: Chatto

Description

Chatto is a simple, topic-based chat application where users enter a topic (e.g., “music”, “coding”, “anime”) and are matched into a chat room with others who chose the same topic.
Users can send and receive messages in real time or using short polling. No authentication is required—users are assigned anonymous usernames.
